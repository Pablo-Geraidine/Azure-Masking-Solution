# Azure-Masking-Solution
Masking Script that works with Azure ADLS2 storage accounts

Data masking solution to move production-level data into development environments while protecting sensitive information and retaining data integrity

Next step for Development Branch: script currently has files electable in column A. Make folders selectable sa well (if a schema can be inferred for the whole folder). 

Future ideation: 
- Have folders and files be selectable in a directory structure in column A, much like excel sometimes organizes dates in year>month>day structures
- Move configuration file iout of excel, into a web-hosted or self-hosted app. Develop app or use some other platform.
